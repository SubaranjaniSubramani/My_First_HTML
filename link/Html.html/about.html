        1. Vanilla
        <P>
        
        Above all types of ice cream flavors, vanilla is America's favorite for a reason: it's simple and it goes with everything. 
        Ice cream expert and IDFA Vice President, Cary Frye, explains, 
        "Vanilla has long been the best-selling ice cream flavor not only because it is creamy and delicious, but also because of its ability to enhance so many other desserts and treats. It tastes great topped by whipped cream and fudge sauce in a sundae, with root beer in a float or atop a warm slice of apple pie." (From WISTV). 
        This flavor is so popular that you can find it at the nearest grocery store!

2.Chocolate
<P>
        Chocolate is a crowd favorite because, like vanilla, it's versatile. 
        Unlike vanilla, it has a lot of variations: chocolate chunk, fudge swirl, mudslide. Along with that, chocolate ice cream is a favorite of many because it can be rich or light.
         It can also be dressed up in a sundae or eaten by itself.
    </P>

 3. Cookies & Cream
<P>
    Cookies & cream is a new take on vanilla, because it has chunks of cookies so your customers can eat a lot without getting bored with their ice cream. This is also great ice cream for waffle cones and ice cream sandwiches.
